    Since I am interested in pursuing a career in academia,
    I applied to be a teaching assistant during my second-year undergrad at the University of Toronto.
    In Fall 2020, I was a <b>TA for Linear Algebra II, MAT224</b>, taught by Professor Sean Uppal.
    I led weekly tutorials with a classroom size of 30, held office hours and graded assignments.
    Every TA in the course is given a handout of practice problems of more than ten questions and is free to choose the
    format for the tutorial session.
    Before each tutorial, I would solve all the questions in the handout and choose a few questions to go through during
    the tutorial.
    As a second-year undergrad, this was my first time leading a tutorial for a university-level course.
    Plus, this course focuses on rigorous mathematical proofs. I quickly became confident in teaching and became better
    at presenting complex proofs.

    In Winter 2021, I was a grading <b>TA in Mathematical Expression and Reasoning for Computer Science, CSC165</b>,
    taught by Professor Francois Pitt, Professor Lindsey Shorser and Professor Kirill Serkh.
    This course is the foundational Computer Science theory course. In a teaching team of more than 12 TAs, I
    participated actively in the marking scheme calibration and communicated frequently with my colleagues to ensure
    consistent marking.

    <br><br>

    At Marianopolis College in Montreal, I was selected by my Calculus teacher as a <b>grader</b> in 2019. I was also a
    <b>peer tutor in chemistry</b> in 2018.

    I love the academic community and enjoy interacting with students and professors to discuss challenging problems.
